Hi, Iâ€™m Nikhil! About me:
- I'm a current sophomore at Duke University, studying Biomedical Engineering & Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- I'm interested in just about everything tech and policy, but especially emerging tech in digital health, space exploration, and ar/vr/xr applications.
- I'm currently familiar with Java, Python, and C, and I'm looking for more opportunities to use and grow these skills.
- Contact me at nikhilmethi06@gmail.com!
