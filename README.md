Hi, I’m Nikhil! I'm a current sophomore at Duke University, studying Biomedical Engineering & Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm interested in just about everything tech and policy, but especially emerging tech in digital health, space exploration, and ar/vr/xr applications. I'm currently familiar with Java, Python, and C, and I'm looking for more opportunities to use and grow these skills. Contact me at nikhilmethi06@gmail.com, and check out some of my projects below:

- Visibly: a nonprofit for queer undergraduates in tech and engineering!
- Decidedly Undecided: [my blog!](nikhilmethi.beehiiv.com)
